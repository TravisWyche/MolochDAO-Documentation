# Paladins

**Paladins** - They work to coordinate all of the circles in DAOhaus. Paladins make sure DAOhaus is on track with its scheduled deliverables as outlined in the roadmap, and they continuously provide feedback to the different circles based on information they gather.

Our Circles section is a work-in-progress. Want to contribute?

Head to the [DAOhaus Discord](https://discord.gg/bUd7HqMx), indicate your role as "Contributor" and reach out!
