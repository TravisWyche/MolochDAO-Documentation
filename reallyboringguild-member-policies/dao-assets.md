# DAO Assets

The assets of the DAO are overseen by committees and/or guilds that have dedicated themselves to specific areas of focus. Committees and guilds may enlist outside help on administering tasks on an ad hoc, as-needed basis subject to the approval of the Project Lead charged with stewarding the asset. If multiple committees or guilds require access to an asset, they must coordinate their activities amongst themselves. If committees, guilds, or other entities identify a conflict of interest regarding access to an asset, they must follow standard conflict resolution procedures (see: Section 3.6 Conflict Resolution).

#### Definition of DAO Assets 

An asset is a resource with value that the DAO operates with the expectation that it provides a current or future benefit for the community. Assets are created to increase the DAOs value or benefit the daily operations.

#### List of DAO Assets 

1. Website 
2. Twitter account 
3. Logo/branding, graphics, PR initiatives 
4. Discord Moloch DAO member forum 

#### Asset Tasks 

1. Website maintenance, updates, blog posts, announcements, etc. 
2. Twitter admin: public outreach, Q\&A response, other PR 
3. Management of brand design, graphic design for all PR outlets, UX/UI of internal tools, avatar creation, general aesthetic vision for the DAO 
4. Discord admin: public outreach, Q\&A response, maintaining relationships with other DeFi and DAO communities 
5. Forum admin: moderation, archiving, custodial, maintenance

#### Creative Assets 

“Creative” Guilds Any member or guild that wishes to be involved in the creation or management of creative assets should follow these steps: 

1. The member should found a guild according to Section 3.3 Starting a New Guild. The guild may be classified as either an operational guild (if, for example, the motivation is to maintain long term administration over a specific set of DAO assets) or as a research guild (if, for example, the motivation is to propose a seasonal marketing campaign or a single asset deliverable). 
2. The guild should submit a project proposal outlining their aesthetic vision for specific deliverables. This proposal is reviewed by Moloch members on a quarterly basis along with the other research proposals and various requests for funding. Permission for access to DAO assets, control over creative direction, and other allowances must be made explicit in the proposal. Members impart value and autonomy to the project through their votes. As in all cases, the members shall not arbitrate or serve as a judiciary in determining the creation or mobilization of assets. 

#### Oversight of Assets 

In the untimely event that any member disagrees with the use of creative assets they are encouraged to express their views through the following procedures: 

1. The member may petition to join the guild creating or managing the assets in order to be more directly involved. 
2. The member may reach out to the guild project lead to express their discontent. 
3. The member may form a member committee to raise the issue with the Moloch DAO community.

Once a research guild’s project application is approved by the on-chain member vote, the guild shall retain autonomy over their creations. Once an operational guild’s project application for the management of Moloch DAO assets is approved by the on-chain vote, the guild shall retain autonomy over their managerial decisions. **As with all application procedures in Moloch DAO, members provide value to projects through their approval of funding while individual projects and guilds provide value by continuing to apply for funding.** If an individual member or committee of members decides that they no longer value the creative contributions of a guild they can make a movement to deny funding to that project during the next quarterly application review.

The Really Boring Guild is currently tasked with the creation and management of DAO assets (as of the time of this writing). Any member that wishes to engage with the creative process is encouraged to contact the RBG Project Lead directly for more information.

If a guild wants to be successful and have their funding reapproved on the next submission cycle they will be expected to conduct research (via member interviews, ecosystem analysis, or whatever means they deem appropriate) to gauge member expectations while working to deliver a product that will satisfy the goals outlined in their proposal.
