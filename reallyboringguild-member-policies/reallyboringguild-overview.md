# ReallyBoringGuild Overview

MolochDAO, like every organization, requires a lot of organizational labor, custodial care, administrative housekeeping, and other tasks to keep the group running smoothly. The Really Boring operational guild handles the day-to-day procedures that include (but are not limited to): marketing, website maintenance, public relations, social media, outreach, branding, graphic design, planning member meetings, copyediting and conceptually clarifying DAO agendas, and even maintaining the handbook you are now reading.

The RBG is really not so boring, but consists of a dynamically changing group of proactive people spread all over the world that share in the common desire to learn more about the Ethereum blockchain and contribute their efforts towards making the DAO run more efficiently with whatever their specialized skill set might be. As the original MolochDAO guild providing infrastructural labor for community operations, the RBG has opted to delegate the financial distributions of its contributors to the purview of a member committee. This committee maintains the RBG multisig in order to maintain economic transparency with the rest of the Moloch DAO member community.
