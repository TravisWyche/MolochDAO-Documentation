### How to contribute to Moloch Docs? <a href="how-to-contribute-to-daohaus-docs" id="how-to-contribute-to-daohaus-docs"></a>

As the MolochDAO's documentation's code lives on Github, you will be required to use Github and Markdown to contribute to documentation.

**INFO**

Are you new to contributing and submitting PRs to open-source projects? [This link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/) from FreeCodeCamp is a good place to start.

For you to contribute to DAOhaus docs, these are the steps:

**1. Go to **[**DAOhaus website's Github**](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-website/issues)** to look for open issues**

**2. Select an issue & comment on the issue thread to let us know you're working on it**

> Above is an example
>
> **Issue** "Can a DAO member request loot?"
>
> * **Where in the docs?**: `Pre-revamp FAQ section` under `Proposals` (i.e. You can click "[https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-website/blob/prod/docs/users/proposals-faq.mdx"](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-website/blob/prod/docs/users/proposals-faq.mdx%22) to access the file directly)
> * **What help is needed?**: Based on the prompt `Yes, under your funding proposal, you can add a field "Loot Requested" to request loot`, create an `answer with screenshots` on requesting loot

**3. Fork the **[**daohaus-website repo**](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-website)

**4. Create a new branch with the naming convention "edit/issue-`ID` "**

> In the above example, the issue's ID is #24, so the branch should be issue-24

**5. Make the changes on your branch**

**6. Once you are done, commit and push the changes onto edit/issue-`ID` branch on your own repository**

**7. Submit a Pull Request to HausDAO's daohaus-website repository**

**8. Reviewers / moderators will review the changes, ensuring that answers are (1) accurate (2) adhering to our **[**style guide**](https://hackmd.io/vI1\_pmTJTmy2\_u0U7ZYQbA?both#43-Style-Guide)** (below)**

**9. Once both criteria are passed, your changes will be approved, merged and live! ðŸŽ‰**
