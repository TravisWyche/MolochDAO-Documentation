# Compensation

#### Payment Requests

* Payment requests should be submitted by 09:00PST on the 6th of the month for the prior month's work. This will include the total number of hours worked in the pay period. It may take up to 7 days after the request is submitted to receive payment. The payout threshold is 1000 DAI or the equivalent in ETH. Contributors that earn less than 1000 DAI will have their payments carried over into the next pay period. In the event that a contributor resigns from the RBG before reaching the 1000 DAI payment threshold they should make note of this status change in their final payment request to avoid delays.&#x20;
* Contributors have the choice to be paid in DAI or ETH. Hourly rates are determined in DAI. The ETH exchange rate is determined by current market values at the time of payment transfer, subject to the volatility of ETH. Changes to payment currency (DAI or ETH) can be made every 3 months.&#x20;
* Payment requests are approved by a member committee that has been delegated to the RBG multi-sig.

#### Value Level

Levels are based on expected value delivered to MolochDAO. This is a fuzzy concept which does not and should not have a precise definition. It can, however, be measured by one or more of the following depending on the context: `experience, skill, ability, talent, knowledge, etc.`.

Contributors self-assess their starting level and level up by contributing more through RBG.

**Level 1: Novice**

For example:

* New to crypto, web3, and DAOs
* Some experience within their area(s) of interest
* Just beginning to gain knowledge

**Level 2: Learning**

For example:

* Some experience with crypto, web3, and DAOs
* Moderate experience within their area(s) of interest
* A little knowledgeable

**Level 3: Solid**

For example:

* Experienced in crypto, web3, and/or DAOs
* A couple years of experience in their area(s) of interest
* Pretty knowledgeable
* Shows promise, but needs practice and refinement

**Level 4: Expert**

For example:

* Expert in crypto, web3, and/or DAOs
* Many years of experience in their area(s) of interest
* Very knowledgeable
* Very talented

**Level 5: Master**

For example:

* Mastery in crypto, web3, and/or DAOs
* Recognized leader in their area(s) of interest
* Extremely knowledgeable
* Highly talented

#### Commitment Level

Levels are based on the commitment the contributor makes to RBG. Like value, commitment is a fuzzy concept which does not and should not have a precise definition. It can, however, be measured by one or more of the following depending on the context: `time, dedication, focus, prioritization, effort, etc`.

Contributors select their own commitment level, as a percentage of the highest level (Full Commitment)

**100% (aka “Full Commitment”)**

For example,

* Full time: 35-40+ hrs/week
* MolochDAO is top priority
* MolochDAO is the main point of focus\*
* Willing to go above and beyond to make MolochDAO succeed

**And some examples of lower commitment levels:**

**Example Level: 50%**

For example,

* Half time: \~20 hrs/week
* MolochDAO is 1st or 2nd priority
* Focus split across a few projects

**Example Level: 15%**

For example,

* Fractional time: 5-10 hrs/week
* MolochDAO is 3rd, 4th, or even 5th priority
* Focus split across many projects

_\*We encourage contributors to save some time for themselves to explore and collaborate around the greater ecosystem._

#### Base Compensation Amounts

**Monthly Base Compensation Max (Value Level 5; 100% Commitment):** ==$12,000==

* Lower Value levels drop off from there
* Lower Commitment levels (eg 50%) are simple percentages of the max

### Initial Mechanics

#### Setup

**Self-Assessment Form**

At genesis, each commitment track contributor fills out a form to set the following for the next two months:

1. self-assess their Value Level
2. set a Commitment Level %
3. identify the circles they (wish to) contribute to
4. Sign off on MolochDAO/RBG mission and values

This process is repeated again by each contributor every 2 months to reassess.

**Buddy System**

Each commitment track contributor must have a buddy.

Prior to filling out the self-assessment form, buddies should meet to review and discuss the following:

* Self-assessments
* Community health
* Any other concerns, recognitions, or points of order to raise with RBG
