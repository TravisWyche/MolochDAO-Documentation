# Roles

**Alchemists**

This circle is fascinated by tokenomics, providing critical insights and feedback to ReallyBoringGuild on how it can improve our own microeconomies.

**Magesmiths**&#x20;

These people are responsible for the maintaining and improving of the MolochDAO platform, think subgraphs and custom fields for interfacing with data or building in new functions for our DAO.

**Paladins**

They work to coordinate all of the circles in ReallyBoringGuild. Paladins make sure MolochDAO is on track with its scheduled grant pipeline as outlined in the roadmap, and they continuously provide feedback to the different circles based on information they gather.

**Rangers**

This circle is focused on growing MolochDAO and spreading the DAO gospel. Rangers keep communications flowing and are dedicated to engaging with the wider community of DAOs through community events, podcasts, newsletters, and social media.
