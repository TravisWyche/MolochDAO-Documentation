# Becoming a MolochDAO Member

Becoming a member of Moloch DAO One can gain membership into the DAO through one of the following methods.

1. Contribute one share (based on market value of ETH (equivalent to $1,601.45USD at the time of this writing) worth of labor for an existing guild. This ETH can then be wrapped and submitted as tribute to mint one share in the DAO. 
2. Provide the equivalent of $16,014.5USD of ETH (subject to current market value) to mint ten shares. This method is the default member application procedure for those who do not wish to contribute labor. 
3. Be among the ranks of a team, research initiative, or guild that has been approved for funding by the DAO. Since grants are distributed as shares to the awarded parties, they will retain member privileges until they decide to burn their shares (thereby converting them back to WETH to provide liquidity for their team).

After becoming a member by one of these three methods, one gains permission to submit proposals to fund projects or create guilds, participate in soft polls, and cast on-chain votes.
