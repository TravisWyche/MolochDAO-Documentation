# Roles

Reviewers, Committees, Liaisons, and Champions are resources that guilds or individual members of the DAO can use to assist with vetting proposals, decisions regarding the distribution of funds, and other supplementary tasks. Reviewers, Committee members, and Liaisons should plan on dedicating 5 hours a quarter to their tasks, whereas a member serving as Champion should expect to contribute at least 1 hour per quarter. 

#### Reviewers 

Members and non-members that are available to provide review on proposals before the soft poll will be collected on a roster to be called upon as-needed. Reviewers will scrutinize proposals and provide their recommendation for funding or passing, accompanied by a short description of why the initiative or project should or shouldnâ€™t be funded. Any and all members are encouraged to participate in the review proceedings for new proposals, guilds, initiatives, and other items on the current agenda. Non-members are also encouraged to participate in their justified area of expertise on an as-needed or invitational basis. 

#### Committees 

Committees are composed of members and invited subject matter experts. Committees may source proposals in their area of expertise, oversee the management of operational guild multi-sigs (as is the case with the Really Boring Guild), or provide other forms of member-specific support to teams and guilds. Any member may organize their own committee and there is no formal procedure for doing so; they simply announce the formation to the member community through Discord. Committees retain no formal arbitrative or judicial powers. They serve to provide oversight to specific areas of focus and represent the needs of the entire member base. If any individual member disagrees with the formation or activity of a committee it is their responsibility to voice their discontent directly to their fellow members. Guilds and funded teams may request Moloch DAO member committee oversight for particular aspects of their operations, such as maintaining economic transparency or political neutrality among their contributors. 

#### Liaisons 

The liaison is responsible for leading the Section 4.1 Proposal Process efforts for a project or guild they are passionate about funding. The liaison is responsible for gathering and synthesizing the materials and information necessary for the DAO members to be able to make an informed voting decision. This includes:

1. Inviting any interested DAO members to join calls with the project. 
2. Soliciting questions from DAO members about the project and collating the answers into reports for other members to review. 
3. Sharing relevant information as needed to the DAO.

The liaison may designate other members to execute tasks in this process, but will remain responsible for the work.

The liaison is a temporary role meant to aid and support the grant making process of the DAO by further decentralizing the management of relationships during the examination and scrutiny phases of the Section 4.1 Proposal Process.

The liaison will chaperone the project from its inception in Phase 1 Examination until it advances beyond the Phase 3 Soft Poll, at which time a Champion will be summoned to process the Phase 4 On-Chain Vote. The Liaison can also serve as the Champion, but if the Liaison does not have the capital to submit a proposal, another member is needed that will serve as the Champion.

#### Champions 

For a proposal to advance to the Phase 4 On-Chain Vote, a Champion must be summoned. A Champion requires 10 WETH to submit proposals (not to be confused with Moloch shares) and can expect the WETH to be returned after the proposal is processed. 0.1 ETH may be lost if another entity (human or bot) processes the proposal. However, the Really Boring Guild will reimburse the 0.1 ETH in the event that a Champion is unable to process their own proposal. Really Boring Guild will also reimburse gas costs that Champions may incur for submitting and processing proposals. 

#### Delegates 

Upon a guild or project being awarded a grant by the DAO, the role of the liaison for the project is deemed complete and is dissolved and they must determine for themselves how their shares will be delegated within their own ranks.

The delegate is responsible for providing [brief monthly status updates](https://www.molochdao.com/status) as well as more comprehensive quarterly progress reports to be included in the member digest, assuring that the guild/project fulfills their obligations for which they received funding and announcing any status changes.
