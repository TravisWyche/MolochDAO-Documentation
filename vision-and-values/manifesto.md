## How we think about MolochDAO

### What Moloch is _not_

1. **Moloch is not a company.** It does not have a board. There is no CEO, there is no team of managers. There is no room for bureaucrats.
2. **Moloch does not have investors.** There are no VCs, no angels, no SPACs, and no SPVs that are pulling the strings in the background.
3. **Moloch does not cater to speculators.** Pump it, dump it, hedge it, short it, long it, lend it, nobody cares. Yearn is agnostic to price.
4. **Moloch does not have an official voice.** There’s no legal entity, there’s no foundation, no copyright, no patent, no central authority to stamp announcements with official seals from some great leader.
5. **Moloch is not owed anything from anyone.** Contributors come together and work on this project voluntarily. Nobody has authority over anyone else, and nobody owes Yearn anything. Similarly nobody has any right to ask anything from Yearn. You get back what you put in.

### What Moloch _is_

1. **Moloch is a collective of contributors.** There is no difference between “the team” and “the community”, they are one and the same.
2. **Moloch is equal opportunity.** No matter who you are, you are free to use Yearn, and you have the same right and privilege as anyone else.
3. **Moloch is for buidlers.** Come with your ideas, come with your passion, come with your creativity. Actions speak louder than words.
4. **Moloch is for self starters.** See something that’s broken? Fix it. Don’t ask for permission, ask for forgiveness.
5. **Moloch is for collaborators.** Find others who are like minded, self-organize, and get stuff done.
6. **Moloch is influenced by merit.** MolochDAO runs on proof of work. Your contributions and commitment to Moloch dictate how much others listen to your voice —not your status, your wealth, or who you’re friends with.
7. **Moloch is constantly evolving.** What MolochDAO is today, may not be what it is tomorrow—what you do after reading this may change Moloch forever. It’s up to you. 🤘🏽👹🤘🏽
