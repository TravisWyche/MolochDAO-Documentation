# Manifesto

The world as an economic game of autonomous actors playing against themselves and the game itself.

Not an altruistic game; all players are rivalrous, so we need rules to remove the fragility of trust and ensure long-term success of the entire human network, to insure that each player does not need to remain focused on the meta view (can remain self-interested while knowing that they are able to support the common good).

Schmachtenberger’s notion of existential risk put in relation to the multipolar traps: the conceptual bridge between ETH as digital public goods and the “impossible” problems of the meatspace.

What exactly are the human values that would be thrown under the bus in the name of efficiency/optimization? Relates to the need for inclusive cultural curation to oppose the narrative of pure coordination/optimization schemes: the need to articulate real examples of humanity and avoid totalizing/totalitarian abstraction.

System fragility in relation to existential game design: emergence is a potentially dangerous idea if we don’t hold ourselves (as designers) accountable to the parameters of that emergence, ie: economic games are definitely not nature, not natural. Our goal as existential game designers aligned on the common goal of slaying Moloch should be to craft anti-fragile systems, ie: games that incorporate lots of redundancies and thereby avoid producing more of the same fragile (efficient) industrial (destructive) processes.

A vision of automation: whether this is a general notion of AI/AGI or more local reference to DeFi mechanics, or something in between, MolochDAO should be dedicate to responsible automation/coordination/optimization processes. Smart contracts > automated global financial system > an artificial general intelligence turning the world into a paper clip machine = a very real existential risk that should be taken seriously.

We (humans) must unpack our fetishization of the meme of the superorganism. Our systems are fundamentally synthetic; humans separate themselves from the self-healing, autogenerative, and sympoietic systems of nature through our reliance upon abstract reason/rationality/logic. We (humans) cannot design systems that are both efficient and natural; natural systems are not efficient, not should we render them as such. We should strive to design anti-fragile systems, to insure sustainability via future public goods and retroactive funding. This amounts to a sacrifice of efficiency itself: in optimizing for the future we sacrifice the immediate gains of the present. This is paradoxical in relation to recognizing the need for competition.

First, we must win the race. Second, we must rearticulate the stakes of the race as no longer a race to the bottom to become a horizontal, collaborative, cooperative, reciprocal constructivism. How to resolve this internal paradox, of the DAO and the entire ecosystem?

MolochDAO will allocate and distribute funding to support exploration in both directions simultaneously, ie: the race to the bottom to avoid the multipolar traps we are entrapped into playing, and the hope that we might still design an alternative game that does not result in Moloch consuming the world, earth-scale computational paper clip machines, or other forms of coordination failure.
