# Treasury Management

If MolochDAO awards a grant to a project that later launches a token, the DAO will welcome the generous distribution of tokens to a MolochDAO reciprocal grant multi-sig. The DAO champions reciprocity between all entities operating upon the Ethereum blockchain as this behavior fosters financial sustainability and stability for the entire ecosystem.

Moloch DAO currently lacks an adequate treasury committee or guild tasked with managing the assets accumulated from reciprocal grants and replenishing the DAO treasury. Members are encouraged to consider the best way to attend to this need, either as a member committee overseeing a DAO fund multi-sig, through the creation of a new operational guild that stewards the collective funds, or some combination of the two.

However it is envisioned, this entity must manage a multi-sig wallet or sub-DAO to receive community token distributions.
