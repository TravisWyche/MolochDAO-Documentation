# Community Governance

### From a Technological Perspective

The Moloch DAO v2 smart contract standard is inherently well suited to facilitate MCV's community governance goals by virtue of several features: 

_**Membership is Permissioned**_

* _Membership Admission is Permissioned_: Membership for MCV is a permissioned processes which reflects the wisdom of MCV's existing membership. Before new membership proposals are submitted on-chain and voted on, candidates must first be championed by an existing member of MCV and undergo internal member-driven evaluation where various aspects of their membership are considered: culture fit, expertise, legal viability, etc...
* _Continuing Membership is Permissioned and Community-Policed_: For a person to continue being a member of MCV, that person must implicitly have the consent of an economic majority of MCV members. Any member may at any time propose that another member be expelled from the DAO, and if that proposal is approved by sufficient other members, the person will lose their MCV shares and governance rights while receiving (through one of the mechanisms as described under "Exiting Members" below) payment tokens and claims tokens representing the percentage of MCV's property to which the member is entitled under the Grimoire.

Membership shares, although they can potentially be viewed as "tokens" in a loose sense (because they are intangibles with balances tracked on Ethereum), are non-transferable. The Grimoire also prohibits sharing of private keys of the address that "owns" MCV shares on Ethereum, except in the event of a change in ownership by operation of law, such as when a member dies or, if the shares are community property in a marriage, upon a divorce. 

**Membership Resignation/Reduction is Permissionless**

Moloch DAO v2 smart contracts embodies the cypherpunk design principle of "opt-in" and self-sovereign choice, and thus exit from the DAO has been made as easy, trustless and economically riskless as possible. Hence, each MCV is member is able to RageQuit at any time with respect to all or any portion of the member's shares and receive payment tokens and claims tokens representing the percentage of MCV's property to which the member is entitled under the Grimoire by virtue of the number of shares the member holds in the DAO.
