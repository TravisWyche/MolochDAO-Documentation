# Channels

Within the Raid Guild Discord, you’ll notice a suite of Categories each full of different sub-channels. Here’s what you need to know about each.

### Public <a href="public" id="public"></a>

Public channels are available to everyone in the Discord. This offers a crossing ground for Apprentices and Guilders and is largely recreational. Guilders should keep a close eye on #projects as this is where Apprentices are earning their chops and contributing to better refine the Guild.
