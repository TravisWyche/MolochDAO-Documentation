# Proposal Flow - v1hb

Members are encouraged to post any interesting projects they find in the #discovery channel of the Moloch DAO Discord server. The post must include the project’s URL, a description of its importance, and any other relevant identifying information for other members to understand the context of the project. \[insert template URL here].

Inbound submissions that come through our website will be posted in the #zapier-feed channel. If a member finds a submission interesting, they should share that in the #discovery channel.

Moloch DAO is adapting a grant management process (adapted from Metacartel Venture DAO’s deal flow process) that divides grant review into five distinct maturity phases:

1. Examination
2. Scrutiny
3. Soft Poll
4. Official Vote
5. Portfolio Phase 1: Examination After the deadline for the current grant wave, members should spend time reviewing projects shared in the #discovery channel. If any DAO member believes the project should be examined more closely, the member should create a dedicated channel for the project under the Phase 1 section of the Moloch DAO Discord and post a note in #discovery that a new channel has been created.

Members are encouraged to review the various project channels and share their comments, expertise, or other relevant insights. An interested member can take it upon themself to set up a call with the project team to gather reconnaissance for the consideration of other members. After the call, the interviewing member should share a debrief in the project channel outlining the key points of what was learned. Use this template as a guide \[insert url here].

If there is no engagement with a project after 7 days of the examination interview and no DAO member is willing to serve as liaison, any member can move the channel to the top of the Benched Proposals section of the Discord server. Phase 2: Scrutiny Assignment of Liaison If any member believes the project deserves to move to Phase 2, that member may volunteer to serve as the liaison or arrange for another member to serve as the liaison. Liaisons must be explicitly named in the pinned message (detailed below). Creation of Pinned Message Once assigned, the liaison should be named in a pinned message in the corresponding channel according to the following format (limited to 2,000 characters):

name of liaison link to project website and/or deck proposed grant terms status of deal ("Soft polling" etc) upcoming dates of note (e.g. call with team) Scrutiny Process If any DAO member believes that the project is no longer a good candidate for receiving funding, they should explain those reasons and declare an intent to move the project to the top of the Benched Proposals section. The scrutiny process also provides the opportunity for Moloch DAO members to identify and suggest a subject matter specialist for the proposal. This specialist will serve to support and strengthen the proposal, can be recruited from outside of the Moloch DAO ecosystem, and will not incur any further responsibilities to the project. The subject matter specialist should be identified in the pinned message at this time. Phase 3: Soft Polling When the liaison believes the project report is complete, they should let the Discord admin know. The Discord admin will create a series of soft polls in the #members-polls channel for each project to gauge the membership base’s interest in funding the projects and tag @everyone.

Soft polls are conducted as one member = one vote; they are not weighted by shares.

The soft poll should be open for 72 hours from the time of the #members-polls post to allow all members a chance to review. If after 72 hours, at least 8 members have voted and more than 2/3rds are in favor of funding, the liaison should advance the proposal to Phase 4 for voting and begin preparing the on-chain proposal. Phase 4: Official Vote Once a proposal has passed the soft poll, it will advance to an official vote.

Official Votes are conducted as one share = one vote; they are weighted by shares in possession of the member.

Proposal Champions should meet on the date for the official vote and submit the proposals to the blockchain in a coordinated fashion. The meeting will take place at 9:00am PST and the votes will be submitted by 9:30am PST.

Once the proposals have been posted on Moloch DAO, the Discord admin should use the #members-announcements channel tagging @everyone to let them know the votes are open. Phase 5: Portfolio If the on-chain vote passes, the project becomes part of the Moloch DAO portfolio.

Note: if a funded project team chooses to ragequit 100% of their shares, they are effectively and officially dissolving their membership within the DAO. If the project team desires to reapply for funding at a later date they must recruit an active member to serve as liaison and submit their proposal for consideration at the discovery phase outlined in Section 4.1 Proposal Process.
