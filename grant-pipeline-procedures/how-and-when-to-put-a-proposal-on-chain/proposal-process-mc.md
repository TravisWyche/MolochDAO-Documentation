**What is the process of getting funding?**

* Post your idea on the forums to get initial feedback from other community members; tweet at us, message us etc. We usually chat and provide very quick feedback in regards to whether the project would be in the scope of funding.
* Weâ€™ll usually reach out to jump on a video call with you and within 2-3 days within the call, you can expect either a strong yes signal of interest (90%+ which receive this get funding) or a response that it is not a fit.
* Submit a proposal on-chain through the DAOHaus platform
* If you get a strong yes signal from us, weâ€™ll likely provide feedback and also have additional feedback for the project before we commit to a grant.

### FAQs

**If I pledge funds and apply for membership but donâ€™t get accepted, do I get to keep my funds?**\
Yes, you keep it all.

**How long does it take for me to become a member?**\
We have DAO meetings every Tuesday where we discuss every proposal that is put forward to the DAO. Shortly after, either your proposal will be submitted onchain or further due diligence is done. Weâ€™ll immediately be in touch with you after the meeting. So roughly 1-2 weeks to become a member.
