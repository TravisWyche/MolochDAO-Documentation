# Proposal Process

#### Requirements to pass proposals

* 3 day discussion on the [forum](https://gov.yearn.finance)
  * At least 25% vote 'for' the change
* 1 YFI in possession to submit to snapshot
* 5 day [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/ybaby.eth) with over 50% passing votes



### Making a proposal

Anyone can post a proposal on the forum for discussion within the community. If it's promoted to off-chain votation (via [Snapshot](https://snapshot.page/#/yearn)), only someone holding 1 YFI can submit it to Snapshot. In case your proposal made it to off-chain votation and you don't have enough YFI, mods will help you.

The default template for proposals can be found on [Github](https://github.com/yearn/YIPS/blob/master/yip-X.md) + on the [forum](https://gov.yearn.finance) if you make a post under proposals or discussion it will auto-fill in the template as well.

### Whatâ€™s the difference between voting for a poll on the forum and an off-chain vote?

* A poll just gauges the sentiment of what the community is feeling on the proposal while an off-chain vote (via [Snapshot](https://snapshot.page/#/yearn)) will be binding and will take effect if it passes.

## Implementation

Once a Snapshot votes have passed, changes will be implemented by Yearn's protocol or operations team and signed by the multi-sig, if necessary.
