Subsequent quarters will follow a similar cadence with a submission deadline being on the 4th Sunday of the quarter’s second month and funds disbursed 31 days later.

Member meetings are to take place on the first Thursday of the quarter’s second month (Feb, May, Aug, November). This provides a 14 day window between the meeting and a PR campaign for the current wave. Member meetings help to identify requests for proposals or papers (RFPs) and discuss teams to be invited to apply for funding.

(Note: the Q2 2021 grants review pipeline was originally planned to start on May 23rd, but it has taken the RBG a longer time than expected to get all of the operational materials in order to ensure a smooth process for all of our prospective grantees, so the schedule was adjusted by 7 days with a Pre-Application Deadline of May 30th. So Q2 2021 is not in sync with how things should ideally work).
