**What is the process of getting funding?**

* Post your idea on the forums to get initial feedback from other community members; tweet at us, message us etc. We usually chat and provide very quick feedback in regards to whether the project would be in the scope of funding.
* Weâ€™ll usually reach out to jump on a video call with you and within 2-3 days within the call, you can expect either a strong yes signal of interest (90%+ which receive this get funding) or a response that it is not a fit.
* Submit a proposal on-chain through the DAOHaus platform
* If you get a strong yes signal from us, weâ€™ll likely provide feedback and also have additional feedback for the project before we commit to a grant.
