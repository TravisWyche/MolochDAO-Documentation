# Starting a New Guild

To propose a new guild, a Moloch DAO member must complete the following steps. 

1. Write up a proposal for a guild, including an itemized budget. The proposal template can be found here (insert URL). 
2. Assemble a team to execute the projects and initiatives of the guild. 
3. Coordinate with an existing DAO member to advocate for and submit the guild proposal. Starting a guild requires at least one Moloch DAO member to serve as liaison. If this DAO member can no longer participate in guild activities and the guild is not yet awarded shares, they must petition for new representation before continuing their research initiatives. Without a DAO representative, a guild cannot receive funding.
