# Research Guilds

Research guilds define themselves in relation to distinct research areas or subject matter. RGs produce reports, blogs, or educational materials that become public commons for the Ethereum ecosystem. 

* Research guilds maintain autonomy to define their topics and focus. Members of the DAO are encouraged to make suggestions and provide guidance for guild research proposals, especially if the research falls under the guise of their expertise. The guild submits their proposal as a funding request with a detailed budget. \[insert URL for funding request form] 
* Research reports serve a variety of purposes. Certain reports may be identified as useful guides to ease development on Ethereum, or to determine teams, projects, or EIPs that should receive funding. Research initiatives can occur at the higher level (user research, market research) or at the lower level (specifying EIPs, standards, implementing PoCs, running technical experiments). Ultimately, it is up to the guild to propose the scope of their research and the responsibility of the members to approve or deny the proposal. 
* If another guild emerges within the DAO that is researching a topic similar to an existing guild, an operational guild or member committee may facilitate a meeting with the research guilds in question to determine potential collaboration and the delegation of tasks. It will be the responsibility of the respective RGs to demonstrate their own areas of expertise in negotiating project oversight. 
* Research guilds function independently from the DAO and may continue to seek funding beyond Moloch. 
* Research guilds determine their own internal governance. As a guild within Moloch DAO, they will be responsible for clearly articulating their intentions in the approved funding agreement before receiving funds. Guilds will be held accountable for providing status updates on funded projects at \[https://www.molochdao.com/status].
